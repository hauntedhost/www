### About Me

Beyond hacking, other interests include meditation[^meditation], martial arts[^martial], and weird horror[^horror].

[^meditation]:
    I'm currently convinced ["The Mind Illuminated"](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Illuminated-Meditation-Integrating-Mindfulness/dp/1501156985) is the best book on meditation I've ever read. An incredible gem.

[^martial]:
    Mostly [Brazilian jiu-jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu), [Judo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo) and [Muay Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_Thai). I also find [Baguazhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguazhang) intriguing, though more for its somatic novelty and contemplative roots than fighting application.

[^horror]:
    Horror in film most obviously, but also graphic novels, music and even [political theory](http://www.redwedgemagazine.com/evicted-art-blog/a-thousand-lost-worlds-notes-on-gothic-marxism).
