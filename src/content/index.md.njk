    ðŸ‘‹ Here's a recent photo of me, looking very ready for coffee at [CafÃ© ArcÃ¡ngel](http://cafearcangel.com/index.html) in [Havana, Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana).

Thanks for visiting my site. You can read my summary bio below, a more detailed [about me](/about), check out my [latest resume](/resume), and [connect with me](#contact).

### 10-Second Summary

I am a web developer with nearly twenty years of professional experience. My current technical focus is on building functional web applications with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org)[^previously] and [React.js](https://reactjs.org)[^react].

[^previously]:
    Previously I worked for several years as a senior [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en) on [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) developer. I switched to Elixir full-time in 2016.

[^react]:
    React with [Redux](https://redux.js.org), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) or [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) for state management.

### Technical Skills

My technical skills include:

  - Elixir, Phoenix, Ecto, (also Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, RSpec)

[^postgresql]:
    Similar to the number [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy), I believe PostgreSQL is the answer to nearly all questions.

[^gulp]:
    This site is built with Gulp and Webpack ðŸ™‚. Check out the [source code](https://github.com/seanomlor/www.seanomlor.com).

His contributions and our ROI can only be described as immense."

### About Me IRL

Aside from programming, some other interests include meditation[^meditation], martial arts[^martial], and weird horror[^horror].

[^meditation]:
    I'm currently convinced ["The Mind Illuminated"](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Illuminated-Meditation-Integrating-Mindfulness/dp/1501156985) is the best book on meditation I've ever read. An incredible gem.

[^martial]:
    Mostly [Brazilian jiu-jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu), [Judo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo) and [Muay Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_Thai). I also find [Baguazhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguazhang) intriguing, though more for its somatic novelty and contemplative roots than fighting application.

[^horror]:
    Horror in film most obviously, but also graphic novels, music and even [political theory](http://www.redwedgemagazine.com/evicted-art-blog/a-thousand-lost-worlds-notes-on-gothic-marxism).
