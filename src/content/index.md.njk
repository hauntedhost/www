<!-- Thanks for visiting my site. You can read my summary bio below, a more detailed [about me](/about), check out my [latest resume](/resume), and [connect with me](#contact). -->

<!-- ### 10-Second Summary -->

I am a full-stack web developer with twenty years of professional experience, and ten years working remotely. I build reliable web applications and tools, often by leveraging [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) on [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org)[^previously], [React.js](https://reactjs.org) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

[^previously]: Previously I worked for several years as a senior [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en) on [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) developer. I switched to Elixir full-time in 2016.

> "Armed with only summary level requirements, Jules built or improved every major component of our app platform (e.g. Rails, PostgreSQL, Solr/Lucene, including social login, UGC & discovery, APIs, unit testing, dashboards and reporting, etc.). His contributions and our ROI can only be described as immense."

Aside from programming, some of my other interests include meditation[^meditation], somatic arts[^somatics], and "weird horror"[^horror].

[^meditation]: I practice vipassana meditation, loosely within the [Mahasi Sayadaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahasi_Sayadaw) lineage of the modern [Theravada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada) Buddhist tradition, alongside [metta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitr%C4%AB). I try to attend at least one 10-day silent retreat every year.
[^somatics]: I'm an aspiring kinbaku (shibari) rigger.
[^horror]: Horror in film, graphic novels, music and even [political theory](http://www.redwedgemagazine.com/evicted-art-blog/a-thousand-lost-worlds-notes-on-gothic-marxism).
