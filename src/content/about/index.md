title: 'About Me'
---
My name is Jules. I am a web developer creeping up on twenty years of professional experience.

<!-- ## 1980s -->

I first started programming [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_BASIC_(TI_99/4A))[^basic] in the mid-80s when I was around 9 years old on our family [Texas Instrument TI-99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A).

[^basic]:

    This was my jam right here.

Within a few years, I upgraded us to an [80286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286) PC that I built from parts. It had one [5.25"](/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk#%E2%80%8B5_1%E2%81%844-inch_floppy_disk), one 3.5" floppy drive, a 20 megabyte [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA#IDE_and_ATA-1) hard drive[^20mb], a [2400 baud modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem#1200_and_2400_bit/s) that changed my life and of course a [turbo button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_button).

[^20mb]:
    I remember wondering how in the world I would ever use this much disk space.

<!-- ## 1990s -->

I continued building Frankenstein PCs from parts I saved up for or convinced my parents to buy me. To their chagrin, I'm not sure I ever closed a computer case in the 90s.[^80286]

    Something like this.

In secondary school, I formally studied BASIC and [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) on a terminal connected to a monstrous [DEC VAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX) in the closet with an entire 256k of RAM for the classroom to share.

I wrote software for the school [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe) to help me study Spanish and which was later adopted by my Spanish teacher for use with other students. I wrote code for my [TI-81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-81) to help work through math problems and which also ended up widely circulated among my peers and used by at least one of my math teachers.

<!-- ## 2000s -->

After high school, I majored in computer science as the obvious thing. These were pre-Java days, and my classes were all in C. Programming in C bummed me out.

In retrospect, I realize that my interest in programming did not include manual memory management.[^rust] I just wanted to create useful software.

[^rust]: Fast-forward, I _am_ enjoying Rust's approach to memory management.

My young mind concluded, "well if I'm not a scientist, I must be an artist." I switched schools and to an art major with a focus on 3D computer modeling and animation.[^3d]

[^3d]:
    Using mainly [3DS Max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max) and [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya). More recently I've started using Blender.

Fatefully, part of my curriculum included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, three Not-Serious Technologies&trade; that computer science degrees would certainly never bother with at the time.

So I learned web development in art school.

After graduating, I got a job doing 3D modeling at an industrial design firm in Germany.[^hanover] It was fun, and I loved Germany, but I couldn't hack German winters, so I moved to San Francisco after one year.

[^hanover]:
    ![hanover](/images/hanover-germany.jpg)

    [Hanover, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover), which many Germans assure me is a boring city, but as a know-nothing American, I found it charming.

In early 2002, in Oakland, California, I got my first job as a "web designer," the popular term then. I've been doing web development ever since.

In the beginning, there was HTML.

In the beginning, there was also `<table>`. Tables inside tables, I heard you like tables? Browsers did not widely support CSS, so inline styles were standard. JavaScript was for sprinkles and definitely not a "real programming language".

I strung together Perl[^perl] for backends and shelled out an infinity of Bash. The Internet was duct taped together with shell scripts.[^shell]

[^perl]: Anyone remember `cgi-bin`?

[^shell]: And maybe still. See [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) with nearly 50,000 lines of shell.

In 2007 I went freelance and lightly dipped into the digital nomad thing.[^zancudo] I curated a roster of mostly small business clients needing steady web development work. I was an early adopter of WordPress and accidentally became a Wordpress guru. The stack is looking a bit more modern now: HTML, CSS, jQuery, and the oft-maligned PHP.

    Playa Zancudo, Costa Rica, where I lived for one year.

<!-- ## 2010s -->

A few years into my freelancing run, I began studying Ruby[^ruby]. I started building custom sites for clients with Ruby, [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com), and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org). This web development thing was becoming more and more fun.

[^ruby]:
    ![the well grounded rubyist](/images/book-the-well-grounded-rubyist.jpg)

    My first of many Ruby books.

In 2012, on a whim, I applied to [App Academy of San Francisco](https://www.appacademy.io). The concept of free tuition until being placed in a full-time dev role seemed attractive. I got accepted and moved back to San Francisco again.

There's some controversy around the boot camp thing. For me, App Academy was an incredibly valuable experience. I feel like I got the crash-course in foundational Computer Science I wanted when I first chose it as a major.

After App Academy, I did a Ruby on Rails tour of duty at several startups[^experience], eventually earning my "Senior Rails Developer" merit badge.

[^experience]: See [work experience](/resume/#work-experience) for more details.

As I gained more experience with production Rails systems, my few, specific frustrations[^rubymeh] began corroding to gloom with each untenable wreckage I wrestled, ultimately crumbling into a broader disillusionment with object-oriented programming itself.

[^rubymeh]: For example, the lack of primitives for safe concurrency leading to convoluted solutions for async tasks.

In early 2015 I began my journey into functional programming, studying Clojure, Elixir[^elixir], and Haskell.

Just one year later, I took a full-time role leading the development of a complex backend in Elixir for a natural language [AI startup](https://www.statmuse.com).

I've been shipping Elixir to production ever since, over six years now. I continue to feel impressed and grateful for this fantastic language, ecosystem and community.

[^elixir]:

    My first of many Elixir books.

<!-- ## 2020s -->

What does the future hold?

- Sharpen my saws: Elixir[^erlang], JavaScript[^tojs] and PostgreSQL
- Dig deeper into GraphQL and Elasticsearch
- Broaden my understanding of [network engineering](https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-007/n10-007-training-course/)
- Find my sea legs with Rust
- Continue climbing the [Haskell](https://github.com/hauntedhost/programming-in-haskell) mountain
- Keep poking at [category theory](https://www.blurb.com/b/9008339-category-theory-for-programmers) and [dependent types](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Typer-MIT-Press/dp/0262536439)

[^erlang]: Also Erlang

[^tojs]: Also [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [ClojureScript](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)
