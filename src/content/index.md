### About Me

Beyond hacking, other [strange loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop) I keep spiralling through: How to see things [as they are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziran), how to be moved by [deep meditation](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Illuminated-Meditation-Integrating-Mindfulness/dp/1501156985)[^meditation], how to remain still while [walking the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguazhang), how to play [chess on the ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu), how to show up with [authentic relational presence](https://www.circlinginstitute.com/), how to share true value in this [floating world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo).

[^meditation]:
    I'm currently convinced ["The Mind Illuminated"](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Illuminated-Meditation-Integrating-Mindfulness/dp/1501156985) is the best book on meditation I've ever read. An incredible gem.
